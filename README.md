# Weather Report 

## Description 

Weather reports are important for planning trips, business travel, reunions and much more. This application is a simple tool one can use to obtain a quick glimpse of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and sun exposure risk for a number of cities world wide. 

The user can enter the name of the city in question and a display will reveal all of the above information AND a five day forcast. The result is then stored for the users convenience if they choose to return to view current status at future times. 

(Clearing the local storage resets the tool.)


## Known Problems

There are several 'issues' would like to fix, but not enough time. 

* Install a "save" or "clear" cache button so the user does not have to see the history if they don't want others knowing what cities they viewed.
* The 'flex' boxes should stack in response to browser resize.
* Better tests for bad input to the text box needed.
* Better color scheme and or explanation of UV index feature would be helpful.


## Installation

This is a stand-alone app that runs in the browser. 


## Usage 

Upon first use, the user is propted to enter a city of their choice in the text field. The weather data for that city is displayed to the right and a five day sequence of icons records the weather predicted over the next five days.
